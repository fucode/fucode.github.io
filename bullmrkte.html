      <br>
      <p class="flow-text study-text">

        For our competitive research, we decided to focus on three goal setting and habit tracking apps that help people
        accomplish their goals. Bullmrkte is a platform to help students focus on their career goals.
        <br>
        <br>
        <strong>Coach.me</strong> has brand recognition and a free habit tracker that comes with the app. The
        typical coaching starts off at $14.99/week.
        <br>
        <br>

        <strong>Stickk</strong> makes you sign a contract that if you do not meet your goals you have to pay a monetary
        penalty to a non-profit.
        <br>
        <br>

        <strong>Beeminder</strong> is similar to Stickk makes you sign a contract that if you do not meet your goals you
        have to pay a
        monetary penalty to a non-profit.
        <br>
        <br>
        <strong>Competitive Summary:</strong> Comparing all the competitors we felt we had to differentiate ourselves.
        Bullmrkte will focus on the niche market of career roadmaps and a mentor network. We will provide free services
        such as career roadmaps, goal setting, and industry trends and insights to gain customers.

                  <strong>Motivation:</strong> John is a driven individual and wants the best career possible for his

                  <strong>Frustrations:</strong> Stacey has no idea where to start in her search for a platform to help
                  students. She also does not have time to find students to mentor. If only there was a platform that
                  could allow her to coach mentor students for the future of tech.

        For branding, we wanted to focus on the idea that no matter what type of job market you must think like a bull.
        You must always be bullish for your career or else you will be left behind. Focus on what skills you can build
        and make sure you find something you love to do. The faster you find it in life the better.

          The landing page took many iterations to complete as we went through prototype testing and preference testing.
          We ultimately decided on using less red because it was easier on the eyes for the end user. Too much red can
          be overwhelming and it is best to use red sparingly as an alert item. We decided to use it as a primary
          button. We made numerous changes on the landing page including changing the color theme, isometric visuals,
          adding more CAB's, and pricing options on the landing page.

        Focusing on the MVP product of career roadmaps and mentorship opportunities first. All the additional

        Always try to create something functional as soon as possible and get it tested. Refinements can always be made
