      <p class="flow-text study-text">
        Everyone wants to become an entertainer, athlete, win the lottery, make money through social media, or some
        other outlier career. Unfortunately, the stats show the vast majority of us will have to
        join the workforce. Demand for high skilled labor and talent across many industries continues
        to get harder and more challenging. It will only continue to get more difficult
        as the population grows, automation continues, and people live longer and retire later in their lives.

      <h3 class="">Problem</h3>
      <p class="flow-text center study-text"> Companies are seeking talented individuals that are ready
        with the right skills to take on challenging high skilled jobs. It can be a difficult and daunting task to
        navigate the treacherous job
        market. It takes a combination of luck, hard work and persistance to land your dream job or career.
      </p>
      <p class="flow-text study-text"> There are so many paths an individual can take to find a meaningful job or
        career. Do you need a degree? Should you take a boot camp? What are the costs going to be?
        Sometimes that path to a meaningful and fulfilling career can take a very long time or never happen at all. You
        will have to go from job to job and try to figure out what works best for you and your lifestyle.

      <br>
      <p class="flow-text study-text">

        For our competitive research, we decided to focus on three goal setting and habit tracking apps that help people
        accomplish their goals. Bullmrkte is a platform to help students focus on their career goals.
        <br>
        <br>
        <strong>Coach.me</strong> has brand recognition and a free habit tracker that comes with the app. The
        typical coaching starts off at $14.99/week.
        <br>
        <br>

        <strong>Stickk</strong> makes you sign a contract that if you do not meet your goals you have to pay a monetary
        penalty to a non-profit.
        <br>
        <br>

        <strong>Beeminder</strong> is similar to Stickk makes you sign a contract that if you do not meet your goals you
        have to pay a
        monetary penalty to a non-profit.
        <br>
        <br>
        <strong>Competitive Summary:</strong> Comparing all the competitors we felt we had to differentiate ourselves.
        Bullmrkte will focus on the niche market of career roadmaps and a mentor network. We will provide free services
        such as career roadmaps, goal setting, and industry trends and insights to gain customers.

                  <strong>Bio:</strong> John is a student at George Mason University and he is majoring in Accounting.

                  <strong>Motivation:</strong> John is a driven individual and wants the best career possible for his
                  future. He was told Accounting has good job prospects right out of college and is a good degree to
                  pursue.

                <br>
                <li>
                  <strong>Goals:</strong> John wants to make sure Accounting is the best major for him and not waste
                  time on a degree that will not make him happy in the future. His goals are to have a successful
                  career in the future that will provide him a livable income. John always had a passion for technology
                  bus is not sure if there is a future for him in the technology world.

                  the job prospects are good. John wants to look at other options but does not know where to start or

                  their talents early on and save time on finding their true passions in life so that they can have a
                  satisfying career.

                  <strong>Frustrations:</strong> Stacey has no idea where to start in her search for a platform to help
                  students. She also does not have time to find students to mentor. If only there was a platform that
                  could allow her to coach mentor students for the future of tech.

      <p class="flow-text study-text">
        For branding, we wanted to focus on the idea that no matter what type of job market you must think like a bull
        for your career.
        You must always be bullish for your career or else you will be left behind. Initially, we wanted to use a lot of
        red throughout the app but after testing, we realized the too much red could be overwhelming for the end-user.

          The landing page took many iterations to complete as we went through prototype testing and preference testing.
          We ultimately decided on using less red because it was easier on the eyes for the end user. Too much red can
          be overwhelming and it is best to use red sparingly as an alert item. We decided to use it as a primary
          button. We made numerous changes on the landing page including changing the color palette, isometric visuals,
          adding more CAB's, and pricing options on the landing page

        Focusing on the MVP product of career roadmaps and mentorship opportunities first. All the additional
        requirements can be added in later. goal setting, accountability coaching, career services, and job trends.

      <p class="flow-text study-text">
        Always try to create something functional as soon as possible and get it tested. Refinements can always be made

        What didn’t work?

        Using too many branding colors with the UI. Too much red was overwhelming for users eyes. </p>

        For the UI its is always best to try to stick with greys and whites with splashes of branding color for CAB
