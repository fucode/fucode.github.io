      <h4>Low Fi Mockups & Testing</h4>


      <p>
        Summary: The users were able to perform the test with ease, but there are some lessons learned for the future: 1)Users were
        clicking on the image instead of the button 2) Users tried to drag the workout, but due to invision limitations they
        were not able to because of limitations to InVision 3) Overall the users were able to navigate the app with with
        ease Overall the users were able to Sign up for an account. Adding a piece of content and organizing a piece of content
        were very similar for the app design. The users were able to add content to the Fitness Program and organize it before
        sending to their client. Lessons learned to improve the solution: 1) Users shoold be able to see the Sign Up Call
        to Action button above the fold on the landing page 2) Users were trying to drag the workouts into the date they
        selected.
      </p>
      <h4>Branding</h4>
      <p>For branding we started off with mind mapping and hand drawn sketchs for the logo. We came to a decision for the name
        of Ferrari Fitness because it is the italian version of the brands founders name, Faraz and then fitness was added.</p>
      <h5>Logo</h5>
      <p>The Logo Design took many iterations for us to come to a finalized solution.</p>
      <p>After testing the logo with users we decided that the below logo was the most easily readable by users and kept a asthetic
        feel Ferrari Fitness was looking for. The logo almost looks like a bull or a birds wings flying, it represents the
        growth and the bullish drive needed to stick to a fitness program.</p>
      <h5>Typeography</h5>
      <h5>Color Pallette</h5>
      <h4>Hi-Fi Mockups</h4>
      <p>During Hi-Fi testing we found 72.7% of users were able to use the prototype with ease. So we felt comfortable in moving
        foreware with our design.</p>
      <h4>Hi-Fi Testing</h4>
      <h4>Iterations</h4>
      <p>During testing users had trouble finding the sign up button on the original design because it was below the fold. We
        adjusted that and added some additional changes for our users. 86.7% users prefered the finalized landing page over
        the original design.
      </p>
      <p>Users felt the original pictures describing the product did not match the theme of the site. 92.7% of users prefered
        the new pictures.</p>
      <p>The footer of the landing page was adjusted after user feedback stating it was not appealing and hard to read. 96.8%
        of users prefered the new pictures.</p>
      <p>During testing users also described how they wanted to see client stories of using the product. So we added it in the
        final design.

      <h4>Conclusion</h4>


      <h5>
        What worked?
      </h5>
      <p>

        <li> User Testing provided much needed feedback on what to change going foreward.</li>
        <li>Using Figma vs. Sketch as a design tool if working across different OS </li>
        <li>Maze is a great way to do testing to get metrics for design.</li>


        <h5>
          Doubts going into the project?
        </h5>
        <p>
          <li> The cloud storage space is saturated with many competitors</li>
          <li>Will users like our design? </li>
        </p>

        <h5>
          What didn’t work?
        </h5>
        <p>
          <li> Trying to work with Sketch when you have to work across different OS systems for design. For the sake of time we
            had to ensure the design team could work across various devices.</li>
          <li> Assuming that our designs were good and we did’nt need testing.
          </li>
        </p>

        <h5>
          Suprises
        </h5>
        <p>
          <li>Users had a very easy time navigating the prototype</li>
          <li>Taking feedback for the logo actualy made it better.</li>
        </p>

        <h5>
          What I learned? In the future...
        </h5>
        <p>
          <li>Test early and often.</li>
          <li>Use Figma if working across various OS systems.</li>
          <li>Ensure something is readable to others users. Something may seem easy to read for the designer, but after testing
            we can see what is the truth. </li>
