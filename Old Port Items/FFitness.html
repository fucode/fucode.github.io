        focus.

      <p class="flow-text study-text">
        For branding, we started off with mind mapping and hand-drawn sketches for the logo. Ferrari
        means "blacksmith" in Italian and is similar to the founders name "Faraz".
      </p>
      <p class="flow-text study-text">
        The Logo Design took many iterations for us to come to a finalized solution.
        After testing the logo with users we decided that the final logo was the most easily readable by users and kept
        an aesthetic feel Ferrari Fitness was looking for. The logo looks like a bull it represents the growth and the
        bullish drive needed to stick to a fitness program.

        During Hi-Fi testing we found 80% of users were able to use the prototype with ease. So we felt
        comfortable in moving forward with our design.
        <br>
        <br>
        <i class="material-icons blue-text">vpn_key</i>
        During testing, users had trouble finding the sign-up button on the original design because it was below
        the fold. We adjusted that and added some additional changes for our users. 86.7% of users preferred the
        finalized landing page over the original design.
        <br>
        <br>
        <i class="material-icons blue-text">vpn_key</i>
        Users felt the original pictures describing the product did not match the theme of the site. 92.7% of users
        preferred the new pictures.
        <br>
        <br>
        <i class="material-icons blue-text">vpn_key</i>
        The footer of the landing page was adjusted after user feedback stating it was not appealing and hard to
        read. 96.8% of users preferred the new pictures.
        <br>
        <br>
        <i class="material-icons blue-text">vpn_key</i>
        During testing users also described how they wanted to see client testimonials, so we added that to our final
        design.

      <h4>
        What worked?
      </h4>
      <p class="flow-text study-text">
        User Testing provided essential feedback on what to change going forward. Figma is a great designtool to use if
        working on non-Mac devices,but Sketch is still superior. Maze is a great way to do A/B and preference testing to
        get
        metrics for design.
      </p>

      <h4>
        What didn’t work?
      </h4>
      <p class="flow-text study-text">
        Trying to work with Sketch when you have to work across different on Windows and Mac computers. To solve this we
        used Figma as well.</p>


      <h4>
        What I learned? In the future...
      </h4>
      <p class="flow-text study-text">
        Test early and often. Use Figma if working across various OS systems. Ensure the design is readable to all
        users. Something may seem easy to read for the designer, but after testing, we can see what is the truth.
